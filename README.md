## Objective
The objective of this Customer Sales Analysis project is to analyze sales data to gain valuable insights into customer behavior and sales patterns. By utilizing Tableau, we aim to create an interactive and visually appealing dashboard that provides comprehensive information on revenue, customer demographics, discounts, and regional sales performance. This analysis will enable data-driven decision-making and help identify opportunities for business growth and optimization.
